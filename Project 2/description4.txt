Number of samples: 10000, number of features: 784

If the number of clusters is 8, we can get the highest ARI score, v-measure score and the average
silhouette score.
However, given the number of clusters 10, we can reach out highest MRI score.
In the figure which plotting Plot scores of all four evaluation metrics as functions of n_clusters
in a single figure, each number of cluster's performance does not varies largely.
